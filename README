NAME
    Test::Reporter::Transport::Legacy - Legacy Test::Reporter::Transport
    modules

VERSION
    version 1.59

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution contains legacy Test::Reporter transport modules from
    when the CPAN Testers project still accepted test report from email. As
    email submission has been discontinued, these module have been split out
    from the main Test::Reporter distribution.

    They are available for historical record and are not needed for CPAN
    Testers. They are provided on CPAN in case someone has built a custom
    testing solution using Test::Reporter and these modules and still needs
    them.
